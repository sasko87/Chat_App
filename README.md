# 🔐 Chat App

This is a **full-stack chat application** where users can **create an account**, **log in**, and **privately chat** with other registered users.

Each chat is private — only the two people involved in a conversation can see the messages. The app also includes **email verification** and **password reset** using codes sent to the user's email.

This project helped me practice working with real-time communication, secure authentication, and user account management using modern web technologies.

## 🌐 About the Project

This application was built using a **Node.js + MongoDB backend** and a **React frontend with Vite**. It also uses **Socket.io** for real-time messaging and **JWT tokens** for secure authorization and authentication.

I also implemented email verification and password reset using **Nodemailer**, which sends a unique code to the user's email.
